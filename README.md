# New-Employee-Orientation-and-Onboarding-Training-Feedback-Survey-Dashboard
When new employees are joining an organization, it is critical they get seamless onboarding and orientation so that they can have seamless integration into the organization. The dashboard evaluated the effectiveness of an organization orientation and onboarding training for new employees. The data collected helped in identifying strengths, gaps, and areas of improvements in the onboarding and orientation process to enhance new employees' retention, productivity, and experience. 
New employees who joined the organization within the last 6 months and have completed the onboarding and orientation training sessions. 

The process involved building an end-to-end data collection dashboard using KoboToolbox and Power-Bi. 
I built the questionnaire using ODK XLS Form, which I then loaded to Kobo Toolbox. After collecting the data using the KoboCollect, I connected the KoboToolbox to PowerBi (using Kobo APIs), hennce I was able to create a live, refreshable dataset.
